This is a collection of tools / scripts that I've written that
automate parts of my life. The tools are written in Go and Python
primarily, with some occasional (bourne) shell and Ruby.

Active:
  denon/ - a simple Go program to set volume and inputs on
           certain Denon receivers (AVR1912)

  grab/  - (to be renamed): a simple timed downloader.
           Give it a URL and a frequency and it'll fetch that
           URL for you. I use it for webcam time-lapsing.

  vps/   - Scripts to provision some FreeBSD virtual machines
           from bare-metal to running. TODO: move to Puppet.
           
  zfs_incr/ - A script that manages incremental ZFS snap backups
              to external storage. Supports GELI.
              
Inactive:
  tg589/    - Scripts for pulling statistics from various DSL
              modems (primarily for graphing).

  esper/    - Some tools I wrote for EsperNet. pm managed irc.*
              pools and did DNS updates. rsec was an experimental
              IRC server implementing the TS6 server-to-server
              protocol. I don't really recall what I was after
              with this project.
