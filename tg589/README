Collect and read back various counters (sync rate, attenuation, signal
to noise) from Technicolor TG589v3 modems. This should work on any
such modem regardless of ISP, but in case it isn't, this was tested on
the Magnet Networks Ireland (www.magnet.ie) firmware.

  collector.py
  ------------
  This script connects to a modem using the HOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD
  credentials at the top of script. It writes out a marshaled
  Python dictionary in /tmp/magnet_state.out every 30 seconds.

  reader.py
  ---------
  This script reads /tmp/magnet_state.out and will return to you the
  key you request. Note: collector.py includes a timestamp in the output;
  this is so reader.py will return no data if it's "too old." The
  tolerance at the time of this writing is 35 seconds. If reader.py returns
  no value (rather than an error), it's likely because the value has
  timed out.

  To use with Zabbix add an agent config like this:
  UserParameter=tg589[*],/path/to/tg589/reader.py $1

  Then add items of the form: tg589[downstream_attenuation] and
  from there you can create graphs.
